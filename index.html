			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>This First week I learned about Data Design and Back end. It was incredibly Stressful, but I pushed through. <br>It took multiple times of it being explained to me before I understood Entities and Attributes.</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>Week 2 went by in a blur. I don't recall everything which is frustrating but I know the more I learn the more i'll retain and the easier it will get. </p>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p>This week was good, We had a lot of fun inputting Capstone ideas and voting for our favorites, <br>And then getting assigned a team and Capstone Project. My Team is the best!<br>We also learned a lot of CSS This week and had a really Intense Challenge that I was not able to finish (even though I stayed up until 12:30). <br>I updated my resume some more and I'm planning to do a lot of CSS and PHP this weekend.
			</p>
			<h2>Visual Speaks</h2>
			<img src="images/prodev.jpg" class="visual" alt="">
				<p>Image 1: Represents my current state, as I just graduated High School and am taking the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. And jumping into the world of Adulthood</p>
				<p>Image 2: Represents Moving up, (thank you Adel), and Prosperity and Business. As I would like to be prosperous and have my own business in a few years.</p>
			<h2>Game</h2>
				<p>I was very focused on the game that I forgot to really watch my teammates.<br>One thing I noticed was that Ryan was anxious to get the treasures right away, Marlon was very thoughtful and planned out his next moves and was aware of other peoples<br>position and special ability, Chelsea was very helpful and really good at the game (maybe cause she went and bought it :D ) <br>But she really was a bit more concerned about the team and was selfless. Me Umm... hehe I was very focused and intent on winning that I may have stepped on my teammates a bit (Sorry!) and I don't really remember what I did Right/wrong.<br>All in all it was a good team building exercise and also helped reveal how people act under stress.</p>
